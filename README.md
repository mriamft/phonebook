We implement our phonebook application. Which contain 7 classes: BST, BSTNode, Node, LinkedList, Contact, Event, and Phonebook (Main class)  
In the Phonebook class, we have chosen to use Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure to implement the functionality of the Contact, and LinkedList data structure to implement the functionality of the Event. Also, we used LinkedList in Class Contact to store the events, and another LinkedList to store the Contact in Event, so the relation between them is Many-to-Many.
We choose these data structure for several reasons, The BST data structure allows for efficient searching and sorting of contacts based on their names. The binary search property of the BST ensures that the contacts are stored in a sorted order, allowing for fast lookup and retrieval operations. The LinkedList data structure is well-suited for scenarios where the number of events can vary and frequent insertion and removal of events are expected. Linked lists are well-suited for maintaining these relationships, as they can easily handle additions and removals of elements without the need for complex resizing or restructuring. It also allows for efficient traversal and access to the related elements.
